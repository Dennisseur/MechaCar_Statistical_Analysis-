# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview:

AutoRU's newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing teams progress.The help fix the issues, AutosRUs’ upper management has called on the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

### Deliverables:

•	Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG

•	Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

•	Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils

•	Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

### Resources:

•	Data Sources:

MechaCar MPG dataset

Suspension Coil dataset

•	Software:

RStudio

## Project Results:

### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

#### Summary

•	According the summary results, vehicle length, ground clearence are statistically unlikely to provide randomn results of variance to the linear model. 

•	The p-value is much smaller then the significance level of 0.05 (p-Value = 5.35e-11). There is sufficient evidence that the slope of the linear model is not 0.

•	With an R-squared of 0.71 there is good chance that this linear model is effective at predicting mpg. There is a 71% chance that the mpg is explained using this model.
