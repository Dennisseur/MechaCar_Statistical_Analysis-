# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview:

AutoRU's newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing teams progress.The help fix the issues, AutosRUs’ upper management has called on the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

### Deliverables:

•	Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG

•	Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

•	Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils

•	Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

### Resources:

•	Data Sources:

MechaCar MPG dataset

Suspension Coil dataset

•	Software:

RStudio
